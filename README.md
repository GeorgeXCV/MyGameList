Basically GoodReads for Video Games, with [IGDB](https://www.igdb.com/api) being the data source. Project is a long way from being finished, moved onto other things for the time being.

Tech Stack: TypeScript, Koa, NextJS and PostgreSQL.

Database tables built locally using PGAdmin4, can add here at somepoint.

Some screenshots of the project (UI far from final):
